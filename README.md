### Pong

[Pong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong) is a classic tennis-based arcade game which was designed by Atari in 1972. .

I made this as a project to as an intro to the gaming ecosystem of `Rust`.

### Used Technologies

The main technologies used (so far):

- `ggez` [2D game framework](https://github.com/ggez/ggez) - `0.9.3`;

### Running The Project

To hit the ground quickly, use [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/):

```sh
cargo run
```

This will compile the game in development mode and run it which should render the game screen.
